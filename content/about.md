Life is being described as a journey by most of the writers. The journey of life has ending and starting point which will not be a preplanned point. In between the journey, it will make us feel all the emotions. At different points of the journey we will feel confused & at later stage we will come to a conclusion for our confusion. But the fact is that each conclusion is a start of confusion. 


I know, it is a about me page.  :p
